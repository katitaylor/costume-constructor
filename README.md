# costume-constructor
A one-page (SPA) app to help narrow down costume ideas.

This application was created using Express, Node.js, MongoDB, mongoose, AJAX, and deployed on Heroku.

The app can be publicly viewed at:

With only one-week to design, build, and implement, I kept my MVP requirements low.

User stories:

User can select wearer (person) and theme (theme) and click "Costume Me!"
If the selections have a DB match, a result will be returned with a costume name and image.

Challanges: 

The project moved very smoothly until late on Day Three at which time I began coding the DB query.  Ultimately, my problem involved needing to creating an apend function in my AJAX call. The most difficult aspect of this project was my lack of experience and, therefore, a learning curve to thoroughly understanding the interaction between AJAX and model/controllers.  While this simple project did not create a fluency, I definitely have a greater handle on the how & whys of languages.

Future iterations would include: 

OAuth with Facebook so a user could share their costume with friends, including a Friends Poll to see if others like the idea. 
Ability to purchase costume through Amazon.com
Additonal selection components and deeper database.
Ability for logged-in users to add costumes to the database.
